In fact, turning real world information into machine friendly standardized datasets can be cumbersome, but inevitable. What is not inevitable though is an error prone, repetitive and hardly transparent approach. This new training camp style course idea plans to work together with research assistants to find their most common needs and use programming to work on these needs hands-on in highly interactive fashion.\nFurther details to be determined. We expect to host the course in 2nd half of 2024 for the first time."

Part of the KOF Lab’s expertise stems from decades of fine-grained panel data monitoring of the Swiss economy, partly through surveys from which micro data are generated. This added value is enhanced by giving researchers access to some of the anonymised micro data and thus increasing the use of the data."
