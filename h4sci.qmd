title: "Hacking for Science Is Back!"
---

By popular demand, we're bringing the Hacking for Science course back to the D-MTEC PhD program in fall 2024.
The course is a highly interactive, online course providing non-computer science students valuable big picture guidance and teaching hands-on software development skills. The course aims to help researchers of all fields who embrace programming as part of their approach to working with data. 
Hacking for Science is part of D-MTEC offering for PhD students but will open to guests from all departments as well as interested guests.

To learn more about the course, including an initial schedule, check our [blog post on the h4sci project](posts/h4sci/).


## Course Concepts
- wizard vs. carpenter
- code as a communication channel
- course speaks to different learner personas
- learn the x’ and o’s of coding
- flipped classroom concept

::: {.column width="70%"}
**Lars Linux** hacks on Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Python R and Julia since he was 15 years old. Internet & social media native finds his solutions in stackoverflow and with the help of LLMs. His team consists of coding-beginners and he  wants to use this course to shift his perspective on how to best mentor and collaborate with them. 

Pain points: he feels everyone throws mickey mouse problems at him and his collaborators can't even use git properly.

::: {.column width="70%"}
**Bruno Berufseinsteiger**  Bruno is in his twenties, works in an entry-level position at a small to medium-sized enterprise. He has considerable autonomy to self-teach new skills. Bruno aims to enhance his ability to work with data without the immediate need to master all tools at once. His focus is on finding practical, applied learning that can be directly integrated into his work.

Pain Points: Bruno finds it challenging to integrate and scale his data analyses due to limited resources. He needs course options that fit his busy schedule and offer immediate, applicable benefits to improve his productivity and contribution to his team.

::: {.column width="70%"}

**Quinn Quantitatives Ph.D.**  Quinn is a quantitative Ph.D. holder with prior coding experience. Her strong background in math and statistics makes her comfortable tackling complex data. Quinn's main objective for the course is to enhance her research collaborations through better use of DevOps tools, open source workflows and improved collaboration strategies with non-quantitative researchers.

Pain Points: Quinn wants this course to focus on the DevOps and group work, less coding basics.

![Peter Ph.D.](images/dr_egghead_panics.jpg){fig-align="left" width="90%"} 
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
**Peter Ph.D.** is a seasoned social scientist with a more than 5 years of experience in qualitative research. Intrigued by the potential of quantitative methods, he's eager to blend these approaches to enrich his studies on societal trends by using data analytics, and to make his research more reproducible once he publishes his first paper. Peter has limited experience with coding, primarily using Stata or R for basic statistical analysis.

Pain points: he finds the transition from purely qualitative to mixed-method research daunting, especially the technical aspects of handling large datasets, and is concerned about keeping pace.
