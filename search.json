This self-learning time is accompanied by a course matrix chat space and the book Research Software Engineering, which itself was created using many of the open source technologies discussed in the course2. The chat allows participants to interact with each other in asynchronous fashion as well as with the lecturer.

Similar to coaching in sports, the course observe participants doing their work offer ways to adapt one’s own patterns and learn new techniques and industry standard workflows. Participants can bring their (PhD) projects, everyday programming issues and patterns to class. The course builds groups of participants with common problems and then discusses ways to improve. Input ranges from workflow to source code, while group outputs range from head-first dives into cloud computing to R Shiny dashboards or profile websites. Each group will have the opportunity to submit an ungraded programming exercise and receive feedback on this exercise at the end of the semester.

Then the keynote speaker, Peter Schmidt, a trustee of the RSE Society UK, gave a talk on RSE developments in the UK, and finally, in the breakout sessions, participants split into groups to discuss three questions related to the development of the RSE@ETH community."

    "text": "Lightning Talks\nWith eight different projects and seven different research areas represented in the lightning talks, you might not think that there would be much in common between the speakers. After all, the speakers were presenting their software solutions for their highly specialised fields, ranging from the need to better control experiments in high-voltage physics through software to anonymising academic peer review.\nHowever, it was surprising to see how well the audience related to the problems presented. The audience noted the similarities in the nature of the problems faced by RSEs, such as data processing and re-entry after errors. Participants recognised the need for a local community that promotes collaboration when faced with similar local issues. This way, researchers do not have to reinvent the wheel every time they want to use software to advance their research."

In addition, he is active in the UK RSE community and hosts a podcast called “Code for Thought”, which touches upon many different RSE topics, such as reproducibility, net zero in computing, and, my favorite: Open Data, without friction. In his talk, Peter shared the journey of the UK RSE chapter, which started in 2013 with a group smaller than ours. He shared some key resources for RSEs, such as the Software Sustainability Institute’s fellowship program and a campaign called the hidden REF which aims to “celebrate all research outputs”, beyond publications and researchers."

This part of the program generated a lot of interesting discussion, which led to the following ideas worth sharing:\n\nQ1: What are the expectations of the community, and how do we get there (short and long-term)?\n\nLong-term: seek SNF funding for joint RSE projects from different labs\nLaunch a mentoring program\n\nQ2: How do we increase visibility, engagement, and diversity?\n\nCreate ambassador roles within institutes\nSeek industry representation\n\nQ3: Should we form special interest groups?\n\nYes, once we reach a certain size: group by interest/technology rather than by discipline\nthe overall aim is not to fragment the community\n\n\nGiven the lively discussions and the motivation felt in the audience, the RSE community hope to be able to implement these ideas as the RSE@ETH community grows.\nAt RSEED, we are excited about the incredible turnout of the event and the diversity and motivation we saw from the RSE@ETH community. We thank the team from ETH’s Scientific IT Services, namely Uwe Schmitt, Franziska Oschmann, and Tarun Chadha, who organised the event. As an emerging competence center for economic data and research software engineering, we want to use our resources to help build the RSE@ETH community in the future.\nIf you are also interested in joining the RSE@ETH community, you can join the Element chat using the link below."

    "text": "Last week, I gave an introduction to Scientific and Technical Publishing with Quarto at the ETH RSE community event. The Quarto framework works equally well with both of programming-with-data’s favorite languages and has become popular in recent years, yet it was relatively little known in audience. Particularly the discussion with RSE experts from a broad variety of fields has been insightful and great fun. Hence, I decided to not only post a quick debriefing summary of the talk but also to take a closer look at feedback from the audience."

    "text": "Quarto Usage in the RSE Community\nTo get started, we ran a minimal online survey among the event’s participants, including an ad-hoc report rendered using – guess what – Quarto. Even though I need to admit that mentioning an Introduction to Quarto in the event announcement may have led to a certain self-selection bias, it was interesting to see how little Quarto was known at an RSE event: More than 71% of our survey participants had never really heard of Quarto.\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(viridis)\n\n\nres &lt;- read_csv2(\"survey.csv\")\nres |&gt;\n  select(id, quarto, programming) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(quarto),\n         fill = programming)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"count\", width = .8) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank()) +\n  ggtitle(\"Quarto Skills by Main Programming Language (0 = never heard of it, 5 = teaching others.\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two explanations for the low prevalence of Quarto among our subsample of the ETH RSE community. First, as expected, in an engineering community, the go-to language for data work was Python, with R a rather distant second. Because Quarto was open-sourced by Posit, the company formerly known as RStudio, it is understandable that the Quarto framework is better known in the R community. Technically, though, Quarto works equally well with Python, Julia or even the JavaScript-based data visualization tool Observable. Second, after decades at the top of academic typesetting, LaTeX still stands strong – even if some love to hate it.\n\nres |&gt;\n  select(id,publishing) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = publishing)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"count\", width = .8) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank()) +\n  ggtitle(\"Main Publishing Tool\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)"

    "section": "Quarto in a Nutshell",
    "text": "Quarto in a Nutshell\nQuarto is a modern framework to help demanding technical and scientific writers create spiffy documents. Outside of academia, its reading-friendly syntax is better received than LaTeX and unlike the output of office world word processors, Quarto’s source is plain text.\nUnder Quarto’s hood, we find (among other things): a TeX installation, the Swiss army knife document converter pandoc and typst, the new kid on the block that set out to succeed LaTeX. All this flexible rendering power is complemented by an easy-to-use CLI and nice templates for articles, reports, presentations, websites and even entire books.\nWhat’s the biggest deal to me, though, is not that Quarto makes typesetting a little more convenient. (A large chunk of Quarto’s target group never asked for convenience anyway.) Writing scientific and technical documents has just become so much more reproducible, interoperable, inclusive and modular:\n\nPlain text syntax allows for smooth work with git. At the same time, Quarto’s syntax helps to lure users with less software development affinity. And modern Git platforms continue to make developer collaboration workflows from issue trackers to Kanban boards and Pull Requests so much more accessible.\nAttractive, reading-friendly HTML output displayed on websites, presentations or a growing number of Online books are a true alternative to the same old PDF documents.\nUnlike Software-as-a-Service online editing offerings such as Overleaf, Quarto, and its ecosystem do not depend on a single online platform and allow to work locally, too. I believe the toolbox described above brings another chunk of use cases closer to the open-source software development workflow and possibly even a new group of people. (Stay tuned for my blog post and workshop on Collaborating on Academic Publications Using Modern Git Platforms)."

This header contains document-level information, including information such as the output format that is needed for the rendering process. But most notably, Quarto mingles the markdown formatted text with source code of an interpreted programming language that is executed at render time. As you can see when you compare the source code of this blog post with the post itself, code chunks are simply replaced with their execution results."

    "text": "From Presentations and Reports to Websites and Books\nWhen quarto projects get complex beyond single documents, project-level information is stored in a _quarto.yml file. In a book project, for example, the _quarto.yml file sources all chapters, including references. This allows you to easily re-order chapters, split work among authors, and alternate between different output formats. Here’s the quarto file of the online version of my forthcoming Research Software Engineering book. The _quarto.yml file contains book-level information such as title, subtitle or author as well as feature activation flags, e.g., search, and a navigation tree to all chapter sources. Quarto books allow for a plethora of configuration options that are a testimony of years of publishing experience and knowing what book authors need in the process of writing a book. Quarto was a catalyst to getting my own book done, pushing around chapters and content across chapters and several iterations of fine-tuning have been facilitated through quarto. Imo, it is also noteworthy that with CRC/Chapman&Hall, a large publisher, not only accepted a Quarto-based draft for publication but even offered their own quarto template for quarto authors.\nproject:\n  type: book\n\n\nbook:\n  title: \"Research Software Engineering\"\n  subtitle: \"A Guide to the Open Source Ecosystem\"\n  author: \"Matthias Bannert\"\n  date: \"7/12/2022\"\n  search: true\n  sharing: [twitter]\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd\n    - intro.qmd\n    - stack-developer-toolkit.qmd\n    - programming.qmd\n    - interaction.qmd\n    - version-control.qmd\n    - data-management.qmd\n    - infrastructure.qmd\n    - automation.qmd\n    - community.qmd\n    - publishing.qmd\n    - case-studies.qmd\n    - appendix.qmd\n    - references.qmd\n\nbibliography: references.bib\nexecute:\n  freeze: true\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo"

    "text": "Typst Support\nAdmittedly, I needed Roland Siegbert from ETH Quantum Device Lab and my colleague Minna to become aware of the appeal of Quarto’s typst support, but now I feel like it’s one of Quarto’s most promising new features. If you, like me, got your scientific writing stack together when iPhone 5s were hot and Gangnam style tested our nerves, you may appreciate a quick catch-up.\nTypst is markup-based typesetting system that set out to become an alternative to both good ol’ LaTeX and office tools like Google Docs or Word. It does so with a considerably simpler syntax and faster rendering than LaTeX, a pleasure-to-use approach and clean, technical templates, including popular academic outlets and the ability to create custom templates. The below syntax is taken from the typst own introduction quickly renders to a beautiful two column layout.\n#let conf(title, doc) = {\n  set page(\n    paper: \"us-letter\",\n    header: align(\n      right + horizon,\n      title\n    ),\n    ...\n  )\n  set par(justify: true)\n  set text(\n    font: \"Linux Libertine\",\n    size: 11pt,\n  )\n\n  // Heading show rules.\n  ...\n\n  columns(2, doc)\n}\n\n#show: doc =&gt; conf(\n  [Paper title],\n  doc,\n)\n\n= Introduction\n#lorem(90)\n\n\n\ntypst two column template\n\n\nThe cool thing about quarto typst support is that you can use both raw typst syntax if you’re already a heavy typst user, or quarto markdown if you’re rather familiar with Markdown. In the latter case, quarto render your-file.qmd will just do the job: create an intermediate typst file create a PDF from there, clean up the intermediate file, done.\nAh, and if you’re into machine learning and ever needed another reason to invest some time into Quarto, you can now host quarto sites on Hugging Face using the new quarto space template :)"
