Open source programming languages, led by R, Python and JavaScript have taken the data analytics and engineering world by storm. This sharing, reproducibility and transparency driven development has not only resulted in a plethora of useful, license cost-free software package but has also established a tremendous communication channel in source code. RSEED aims to help (economic) researchers put their ideas into state-of-the-art software packages in increase the impact of their work in different ways: we make contributions reusable and connect researchers to a vibrant data science and open source software community.
