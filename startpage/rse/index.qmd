Open source programming languages, led by R, Python and JavaScript have taken the data analytics and engineering world by storm. This sharing, reproducibility and transparency driven development has not only resulted in a plethora of useful, license cost-free software package but has also established a tremendous communication channel in source code. RSEED aims to help (economic) researchers put their ideas into state-of-the-art software packages in increase the impact of their work in different ways: we make contributions reusable and connect researchers to a vibrant data science and open source software community.

Thus timeseriesdb is optimized to handle updates caused by data revision as well as elaborate, multi-lingual meta information.

Read Swiss time series data from the 'KOF Data' API, <https://datenservice.kof.ethz.ch>. The API provides macro economic time series data mostly about Switzerland. The package itself is a set of wrappers around the 'KOF Datenservice' API. The 'kofdata' package is able to consume public information as well as data that requires an API token.
