Teaching is an integral part of our work at the KOF Lab for Research Software Engineering and Economic Data. We strive to teach what is needed and to learn continuously in a dynamically evolving field. 
Feedback on existing courses or requests to expand our programme are therefore greatly appreciated. [Join our community](community.qmd) to engage in the discussion! 


## Hacking for Science, ETH PhD program

Hacking for Science is a highly interactive online course that provides non-computer science students with valuable big-picture guidance and practical software development skills. The course is designed to help researchers in all disciplines who are considering programming as part of their approach to working with data. Hacking for Science is part of the D-MTEC offer for PhD students, but has also benefited guests from academia and the public and private sectors.
