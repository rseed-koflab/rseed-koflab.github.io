Teaching is an integral part of our work at the KOF Lab section for Research Software Engineering and Economic Data. We strive to teach what is needed and continously learn in a dynamically evolving field. 
Hence, feedback to existing courses our requests to extend our program are greatly appreciated. [Join our community](../../community.qmd) to engage in the discussion!
