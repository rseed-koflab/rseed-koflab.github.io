One of the three main goals of RSEED is to increase the impact of KOF's unique economic datasets by enabling academic researchers to work with the datasets we built up and maintain. Social and economic data ask for contributions not only from researchers, but also from companies and individuals. To fully value these contributions we are committed to create the conditions to use the economic datasets maintained by KOF while protecting the privacy of individual companies and persons. 


## KOF on opendata.swiss

KOF's economic indicators are KOF's most exposed data. Indicators such as the KOF Barometer (see below) are publicly available and designed for intertemporal comparison as they summarise economic development in a single number.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE} 
library(kofdata)
library(tsbox)
tsl <- get_time_series("ch.kof.barometer")
class(tsl) <- c("tslist","list")
ts_plot(tsl,
        title = "FLI for Switzerland: Economic Barometer",
        subtitle = "source: KOF, ETH Zurich")

```

Comprehensive dissemination of the extracted information is an important part of monitoring the Swiss economy. Hence it is important to follow standards in order to make data not only available but immediately processible. KOF indicators are available from the official open government data (OGD) portal of the Swiss Federal Office of Statistics and the KOF Data application programming interface (API).

## KOF Time Series Database

In addition to its publicly available time series, KOF offers a plethora of finer grained time series including regional and sector specific indicators. The KOF time series data API provides researchers with access to over 30'000 time series on every sector of the Swiss economy.
