title: "Hacking for Science - An Applied Guide to Programming with Data is back."
description: "After a 1-year hiatus, Hacking for Science is back. Hacking for Science is a highly interactive online course for PhD students that is open to interested guests. The idea behind Hacking for Science is to build a solid understanding of core technologies and concepts to help researchers develop a data processing strategy and increase one's possibilities when working with data. We single out those concepts from software development that are fairly easy to adopt and useful to scientists. Hacking for Science will take palce again in fall 2024. Subscription via the ETH course catalog will open soon."

## How Much Programming Does a Researcher Need? 

The vast majority of data has been created within the last decade. As a result, more and more fields of research consider programming to analyze data. Hacking for Science embraces a programming approach to data engineering and analytics as it aims to leverage field specific expertise with the help of the open source ecosystem. Besides its popular demand driven, hands-on programming examples, the greatest value of the course may lie in its big picture understanding. How do Python, R, Julia, GitHub, IDEs, git, Visual Studio Code, geoJSON, Postgres, containers, cloud, Kubernetes and Continuous Integration relate to each other? And do I -- all of a sudden -- need all of them for my research^[Readers who speak German may be interested in the discussion of this question for the profession of empirical economics [@wizcarpenter]]? 

## Online Teaching and Coaching Sessions 

Born during the pandemic, Hacking for Science is a native online course - specifically designed to work well online. The course consists of four two day blocks all of which are at least several weeks apart with a flipped classroom concept in mind: after two days of input sessions, there is a break of multiple weeks that allow for self-learning time. This self-learning time is accompanied by a course matrix chat space and a free online version of the book [*Research Software Engineering*](https://rse-book.github.io) that was itself created using many of the open source technologies discussed in the course.  that allows participants to interact in asynchronous fashion with each other and with the lecturer. Participants decide on their own into which topics raised during the input sessions they would like to take more detailed look.

## Teaching & Coaching Sessions

::: {.callout-note}

Registration via the ETH course catalog will open soon. If you are not an ETH student and/or have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us: **heim [ at ] kof.ethz.ch** 


:::


While the first two blocks of the course are focused on teaching and building a common denominator understanding of the open source ecosystem as a toolbox, the latter two blocks have more of a coaching mindest. Similar to sports coach, participants can bring their (PhD) projects, every day programming issues and patterns to class. The course builds groups of participants with common problems and goes on to discuss ways to improve. Input ranges from workflow to source code as group outputs go from head-first dives into cloud computing to R Shiny Dashboards or profile websites. Each group will have the chance to hand in an ungraded programming exercise and to get feedback on this exercise at the end of the semester. Live session will take place on Thursdays and Fridays from **10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.** and **10:00 a.m to 2 p.m.** including sufficient breaks.
