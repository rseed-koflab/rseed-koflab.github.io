### Wizard vs. Carpenter 

Hacking for Social Scientists is a guide to programming with data, taught by Dr. Matthias Bannert. It is tailored to the needs of a field in which scholars’ typical curricula do not contain a strong programming component. Yet this course argues that what the open source community calls a ‘software carpentry’ level is totally within reach for a quantitative social scientist and well worth the investment. Therefore, the motto wizard vs. carpenter signals that being able to code on a carpentry-level leverages field specific expertise and fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, as source code continues to become an important communication channel, whereas wizardry, although essential, is not as important for an average quantitative social scientist.
