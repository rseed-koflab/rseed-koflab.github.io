title: "Hacking for Science - An Applied Guide to Programming with Data is back."
description: "After a 1-year hiatus, Hacking for Science is back. Hacking for Science is a highly interactive online course for PhD students that is also open to interested guests. The idea behind Hacking for Science is to build a solid understanding of core technologies and concepts to help researchers develop a data processing strategy and increase one's possibilities when working with data. We single out those concepts from software development that are fairly easy to adopt and useful for scientists. Hacking for Science will take place again in fall 2024. Registration via the ETH course catalogue will open soon."

## How Much Programming Does a Researcher Need? 

The vast majority of data has been created within the last decade. As a result, more and more research fields are considering programming to analyse data. Hacking for Science embraces a programming approach to data engineering and analytics, as it aims to leverage field specific expertise with the help of the open source ecosystem. In addition to its popular, demand driven, hands-on programming examples, the greatest value of the course may lie in its big picture understanding. How do Python, R, Julia, GitHub, IDEs, git, Visual Studio Code, geoJSON, Postgres, containers, cloud, Kubernetes and Continuous Integration relate to each other? And do I -- all of a sudden -- need them all for my research^[Readers who speak German may be interested in the discussion of this question for the profession of empirical economics [@wizcarpenter]]? 

## Online Teaching and Coaching Sessions 

Born during the pandemic, Hacking for Science is a native online course - specifically designed to work well online. The course consists of four two-day blocks, all spaced at least several weeks apart, with a flipped classroom concept in mind: after two days of input sessions, there is a break of multiple weeks that allow for self-study time. This self-learning time is accompanied by a course matrix chat space and a free online version of the book [*Research Software Engineering*](https://rse-book.github.io), which itself was created using many of the open source technologies discussed in the course. This allows participants to interact with each other in asynchronous fashion and with the lecturer. Participants decide for themselves which topics raised during the input sessions they wish to explore in more detail.

## Teaching & Coaching Sessions

::: {.callout-note}

Registration via the ETH course catalog will open soon. If you are not an ETH student and/or have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us: **heim [ at ] kof.ethz.ch** 


:::


While the first two blocks of the course focus on teaching and building a common denominator understanding of the open source ecosystem as a toolbox, the latter two blocks have more of a coaching mindset. Similar to sports coaching, participants can bring their (PhD) projects, everyday programming issues and patterns to class. The course builds groups of participants with common problems and then discusses ways to improve. Input ranges from workflow to source code, while group outputs range from head-first dives into cloud computing to R Shiny dashboards or profile websites. Each group will have the opportunity to submit an ungraded programming exercise and receive feedback on this exercise at the end of the semester. Live session will take place on Thursdays and Fridays from **10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.** and **10:00 a.m to 2 p.m.** including sufficient breaks.
