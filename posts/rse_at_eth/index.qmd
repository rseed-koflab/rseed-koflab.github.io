The Research Software Engineering Community was newly founded in late 2023, due to the need of a regional (local) RSE Society which arose on a university level. Although RSE@ETH had its first online information Event on the 12th of December 2023, the gettogether on the 1st of February served as a way to get to know the RSE community at ETH better, and to understand their wants and needs from a community such as RSE@ETH.
