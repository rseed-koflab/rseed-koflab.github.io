Over the last two decades, we have witnessed programming, and source code in particular, become a tremendously sharp, illustrative and hence increasingly popular communication channel across many fields of research. RSEED picks up this chance to leverage our resources: Reproducible dissemination of results, interactive communication of methodological advances and truly accessible data, make research more inclusive, increase its reach and therefore its impact.
